                    PTE Academic test is explicitly designed for students who
                    wish to study in English-speaking countries. PTE scores work
                    as proof of English proficiency for universities to ensure
                    the student can understand and access the study materials
                    given in English. Many countries including Australia and New
                    Zealand specifically refer to the PTE test for admission.
                    PTE Academic test results are only valid for two years from
                    the release of the result.
